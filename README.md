## Where to put things?

### Blog Posts
Create markdown files in the `_posts` folder.
Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`

Example: `2025-12-24-hello-world.md`

### Media (Images, Audio, Video)
Put your files in the `assets/` directory.
- Images: `assets/images/`
- Audio: `assets/audio/` (you can create this folder)
- Video: `assets/video/` (you can create this folder)

To use them in a post:
```markdown
![My Image](/assets/images/my-pic.jpg)
```
