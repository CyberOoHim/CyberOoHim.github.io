TITLE: What is AI for kids Artificial Intelligence for kids.

1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,560
Wait, what if your vacuum could actually

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,720
think for itself?What if your teddy bear

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,680
could do your homework?Whoa, that sounds

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,920
like artificial intelligence.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,120
But is it really that scary or super

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,800
cool?Let's find out Todd's and

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
grade style.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,840
Artificial intelligence, or AI for short,

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,400
is when machines like computers or robots

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,840
learn how to think, solve problems, and

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,960
help people just like you do in school.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,680
But don't worry, your fridge is not

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,480
planning to steal your snacks. AI can't

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,880
think like humans yet. It just follows

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
instructions. Kind of like when mom tells

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,719
you to clean your room and you only do

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,520
half of it. Guess what?AI is

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,920
already all around you. Let's see where

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,879
it hides. One voice assistants like

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,560
Siri or Alexa. I'm Alexa.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,400
How can I help you today?You say play

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,440
Baby Shark and boom, it plays.

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,000
2. Smart vacuums. They zoom

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,320
around and clean the floor oven, the icky

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,519
spots under the couch.

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,840
3. Video games. AI controls the

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
other characters so you can jump, run,

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,920
and score points.

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,760
4. YouTube recommendations.

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
Ever wonder how YouTube knows you love

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
dinosaur cartoons?Yep, that's AI

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,759
too, smarty pants. Is AI going to take

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,400
over the world?Some cartoons make it look

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,960
like AI wants to rule the world, but

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,080
that's just make-believe.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,800
AI can't feel emotions. It can't laugh,

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,600
cry, or play tag with you. It can't take

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
over your tree house or eat your cookies.

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,960
AI is not magic. It's math, coding, and

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,680
learning from data made by super smart

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,000
people. Like maybe you one day.

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,079
Want to sound like a tech genius with

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,160
your friends at snack time?Try these

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,320
awesome AI words. One

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,720
algorithm. A fancy word for a list of

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,200
steps to solve a problem, like a recipe,

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,160
but for computers. 2. Machine learning.

48
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,239
This is when computers get smarter by

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,640
learning from pictures, words, or videos,

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
just like you learn from your teacher. 3.

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
Robot. A machine that moves and does

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
jobs, sometimes like a human.

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,880
4. Code. These are tiny instructions

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,440
that tell computers what to do, like

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,480
giving your toy robot a bedtime routine.

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,920
So remember, kids, AI isn't a

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,160
monster. It's a super helpful tool that

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,680
makes your tablet, video games, smart

59
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,040
toys, and fun apps work better and

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,519
faster. From your tablet to your talking

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,240
teddy, AI is here to make life fun,

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
faster, and a little bit smarter. And

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,920
guess what?One day you can build robots,

64
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,760
write code, and teach machines how to

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,319
help people. If you loved learning about

66
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,560

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,000
