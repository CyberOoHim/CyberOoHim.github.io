TITLE: 5 New Startups That Explain AI's Most Important Trends

[0:00] welcome back to the AI Daily Brief every
[0:02] day it feels like a million new cool AI
[0:04] startups launch so much so that it's
[0:07] actually pretty rare that we dig deep
[0:08] and cover brand new companies on this
[0:10] show and yet over the past couple of
[0:12] days I've seen a handful of companies
[0:15] that are on the one hand just very
[0:17] impressive and interesting and seemingly
[0:18] high potential and additionally really
[0:22] reflect and tell the story of key trends
[0:24] shaping AI right now so what we're going
[0:27] to do today is look at these five or so
[0:28] new companies all of which have been
[0:30] announced literally over the last 48
[0:31] hours or so talk about them or their new
[0:33] products that have been announced but
[0:35] then also put them in the larger context
[0:38] first up we have General Agents ceo
[0:40] Sergio Ojair formerly of Tesla and
[0:42] Google DeepMind writes "Today I'm
[0:44] launching my new company General Agents
[0:46] and our first product introducing Ace
[0:48] the first real-time computer autopilot
[0:51] ace is not a chatbot ace performs tasks
[0:53] for you on your computer using your
[0:56] mouse and keyboard at superhuman speeds
[0:59] now by the way this is a show that's
[1:00] going to be much better if you watch it
[1:02] because there's lots of examples going
[1:03] on you should be able to watch it in the
[1:05] Spotify app or on YouTube but Sherjo
[1:08] goes on Ace can use all the tools on
[1:10] your computer and the video shared shows
[1:12] it grabbing images dropping them into
[1:14] Google Drive and generally doing the
[1:15] types of things that a human would do
[1:17] their preview videos also show the
[1:19] method of interaction in Premiere Pro it
[1:21] shows a user using the Ace bar to for
[1:24] example slow the video clip down to 50%
[1:26] split the clip once with the cut tool
[1:28] and then export it and again you're
[1:30] using verbal instructions and then
[1:32] letting ACE actually do the work they
[1:34] point out that this can be really
[1:35] helpful not just for increasing your
[1:36] speed and efficiency but also for tools
[1:38] that you're still learning how to use
[1:40] there's a bunch of other things about
[1:41] ACE as well but the big thing that
[1:43] they're hammering is that it's fast in
[1:45] fact they claim 20 times faster than
[1:46] competing agents making it as they say
[1:49] more practical for everyday use speed is
[1:51] definitely what caught people's
[1:52] attention with this replet CEO Amjad
[1:55] Msad said "Insane speed computer use
[1:57] models have not seen major commercial
[1:59] breakthrough because they're slow and
[2:00] expensive this is a huge unlock."
[2:03] William Gus a former research scientist
[2:05] at OpenAI who's now a general agent as
[2:07] well writes "Ace is the world's fastest
[2:09] AI computer use agent this is
[2:10] fundamentally a new way to use computers
[2:13] when someone asked "How does it work?"
[2:15] William responded "It takes in pixels
[2:17] and instructions and outputs click drag
[2:18] keyboard etc actions at 300 milliseconds
[2:20] roundtrip latency." In other words it's
[2:23] doing full screenshot image processing
[2:24] extremely quickly now in terms of the
[2:26] discussion around this outside of it
[2:28] just being fast some people pointed out
[2:30] that advances coming from startups like
[2:32] this mean that it's not just the big
[2:33] labs that are going to have all the fun
[2:34] in the new era f schuman on Twitter also
[2:37] pointed out that the expansion of human
[2:38] creativity to go with a theme from
[2:40] yesterday's show is one of the
[2:41] byproducts of this type of computer use
[2:43] tool where as he puts it anyone can now
[2:45] operate software without even knowing
[2:47] how to operate it that is a huge
[2:49] breakthrough and certainly wasn't on my
[2:50] bingo card for this year so there are
[2:52] obviously a lot of themes that I think
[2:54] this startup represents broadly speaking
[2:57] of course agents the most important most
[2:58] dominant category of AI advancements
[3:01] right now but more specifically this
[3:03] idea of expanding agent capabilities
[3:04] through computer use this is something
[3:06] that we started to see inklings of at
[3:08] the end of last year and this appears to
[3:09] be a major jump forward on that
[3:11] obviously if you listen to yesterday's
[3:13] show about the five fastchanging AI
[3:14] transformations that'll keep you up at
[3:16] night you'll have heard me talk about
[3:17] the expansion of human creativity and as
[3:20] we just heard being able to talk at
[3:21] software and have your agent do it with
[3:23] you does absolutely expand which
[3:24] software tools a person can use lastly
[3:28] the fact that the speed of computer use
[3:30] is now exceeding humans I think gives us
[3:32] a glimpse into the future where AI and
[3:34] agents aren't just as performant as
[3:35] people but are actually better at things
[3:38] now obviously AI is better at many
[3:39] things already but this is a highly
[3:41] visual example of that another theme
[3:44] which it's a little too early to explore
[3:45] is whether US state-of-the-art agent
[3:47] capabilities can drive as much virality
[3:49] as recent releases from China like Manis
[3:51] we might be a little constrained in this
[3:53] case because general agents is only
[3:54] available as a research preview not as a
[3:56] full product but still that's something
[3:58] that I'll be watching next up we have
[4:00] Lindy and of course while Lindy isn't
[4:02] new its new swarms feature is i won't
[4:05] spend a ton of time on this because I
[4:06] got into it yesterday but I think
[4:07] co-founder Lindy Drop actually does a
[4:09] great job explaining this she writes
[4:11] "This AI agent turns one workflow into a
[4:14] multi- aent empire working in parallel
[4:16] fed it one event URL and here's what
[4:18] happened it extracted every speaker's
[4:20] details deep researched each person
[4:22] using LinkedIn news and PR found and
[4:24] transcribed their podcast appearances
[4:26] crafted emails with their exact quotes
[4:28] making them impossible to ignore
[4:30] identified lookalike profiles and
[4:32] repeated the process on autopilot the
[4:34] net result she says it just sent 370
[4:37] impossible to ignore personalized emails
[4:39] in seconds versus an entire day of
[4:41] manual work we're building AI employees
[4:44] that run entire companies autonomously
[4:46] what about someone outside the company
[4:48] michael Raspusi writes "First test using
[4:50] Lindy Loops trying out a series of
[4:52] custom deep research agents using
[4:53] Perplexity and Anthropic context: We're
[4:55] prepping for our next AI and health hack
[4:57] so I want a quick update across
[4:58] different non-invasive imaging
[5:00] modalities i texted at LFUS FNIRS and
[5:03] ultrasound and it cooked what would have
[5:05] taken 1 to two hours manually 25 minutes
[5:07] with AI tools took 2 minutes with Lindy
[5:09] AI one more test from Alex Carson they
[5:12] write "Agent swarms let AI agents
[5:14] duplicate themselves to tackle hundreds
[5:15] of tasks simultaneously the new
[5:17] capability immediately scales what's
[5:19] possible with AI automation by allowing
[5:21] agents to divide and conquer across
[5:22] large data sets without complex coding
[5:24] or custom API connections you provide a
[5:26] list of tasks and Lindy automatically
[5:27] spawns duplicate agents to handle each
[5:29] item concurrently
[5:30] testing this feature with a YouTube to
[5:32] blog post workflow showed the impressive
[5:34] potential i created a simple flow that
[5:36] triggers when new URLs are added to a
[5:37] spreadsheet creates a loop that
[5:39] processes each URL simultaneously
[5:41] transcribes each video and generates a
[5:42] professionally formatted blog post and
[5:44] then returns all completed posts and
[5:45] chat messages and so what's the theme
[5:48] here it's not just agents obviously
[5:50] we've already covered agents as the big
[5:51] dominant theme no what's interesting to
[5:53] me is this is effectively my Doctor
[5:55] Strange theory of AI agent work come to
[5:57] life this is not a onetoone replacement
[6:00] for existing work this is the very early
[6:02] innings of what you can do if you were
[6:04] able to hire hundreds of people instead
[6:05] of just one for a particular task those
[6:08] 370 personalized emails that Lindy sent
[6:10] is an example of how you would apply
[6:12] this to sales i think we are going to
[6:14] see so much more of this in the next few
[6:15] months and it's actually going to take
[6:17] the new capabilities being available
[6:18] before people can even come close to
[6:20] figuring out how to actually take full
[6:21] advantage
[6:23] startup number three is called Paid and
[6:26] a very appropriate name it is manny
[6:28] Medina writes "I'm officially launching
[6:30] my new company Paid we just raisedâ‚¬ 10
[6:32] million euro to solve the biggest
[6:33] problem no one's talking about in AI ai
[6:35] agents are growing fast but face a
[6:37] critical challenge how to monetize and
[6:39] capture the value they create
[6:40] traditional software billing doesn't
[6:42] solve this problem at Paid we're solving
[6:44] this problem by smart pricing that
[6:45] aligns with actual value creation
[6:47] real-time margin tracking to ensure
[6:49] profitability clear dashboards that
[6:50] demonstrate ROI to customers billing
[6:52] invoicing revenue recovery taxes and all
[6:54] the back office needs in a single pane
[6:55] of glass with just a few lines of codes
[6:57] AI builders can focus on creating
[6:59] amazing agents while we handle the
[7:00] business engine behind them summing it
[7:03] up even more clearly their website calls
[7:04] this the business engine for AI agents
[7:06] to me this is reflective of the fact
[7:08] that agents are now officially shifting
[7:10] from interesting toys and novelties to
[7:12] actual productionready tools that are
[7:14] going to go in and change how we do work
[7:17] paid is an example of the critical
[7:18] infrastructure that is being built to
[7:20] enable agents to live up to their full
[7:22] potential effectively everything that
[7:24] human employees do now every service
[7:26] that we have around them is going to
[7:28] have some proximate version in the agent
[7:30] world this is going to be an incredibly
[7:32] rich vein for startups in the coming
[7:33] years and as you can see is already
[7:35] happening with Gusto right now next up
[7:37] we're moving on from agents at least
[7:39] sort of to another huge theme of the
[7:41] moment which is of course vibe coding
[7:43] and for that we turn to the company
[7:45] called yes vibe code they write in order
[7:49] for billions of people to vibe code we
[7:50] need a tool with the power of cursor and
[7:52] the simplicity of chat GBT that they
[7:54] argue is the new app that they've built
[7:56] vibe code now this comes from Riley
[7:58] Brown and his co-founders riley was and
[8:00] is I think the world's biggest AI Tik
[8:02] Tocker but over the past six months or
[8:04] so has really gone allin on vibe coding
[8:07] he's been building things for himself
[8:09] using content to come up with new
[8:10] theories of how creators are going to
[8:12] code things in the future and this is
[8:13] the app that he and some friends
[8:15] basically built for himself to do what
[8:17] he wanted to do one of the examples he
[8:19] showed off was vibe coding a mobile
[8:20] video game in a single prompt and what's
[8:22] cool about this if you've used something
[8:23] like Lovable and Bolt is that this is a
[8:25] native mobile interface instead of
[8:27] focusing on web applications Vive Code
[8:30] is starting with a focus on mobile
[8:31] applications and when excited users
[8:33] started posting on the announcement
[8:34] thread that signup wasn't working Vive
[8:36] Code basically said that they were
[8:37] already full up so in terms of the
[8:39] themes here obviously Vive coding in
[8:41] general is a big one but the mobile
[8:43] integration is really fascinating as
[8:44] well as Eddie Yun points out right now
[8:47] the average interaction with vibe coding
[8:49] is still via text but imagine vibe
[8:51] coding with voice funny enough when
[8:53] Andre Karpathy originally talked about
[8:55] vibe coding he talked about how he was
[8:57] using whisper to talk to his computer to
[8:59] do it so in some ways this would be an
[9:01] actual instantiation of where the whole
[9:02] thing started vibe codeandanda writes
[9:04] "The best feeling in the world is when
[9:06] you build something and others can use
[9:07] it with vibe code we hope to enable
[9:09] anyone get that feeling." And of course
[9:11] that is the big resonance of vibe coding
[9:14] with people is this expansion of human
[9:15] creativity and creative capacity and
[9:18] that was not the only example one of the
[9:20] challenges for vibe coders is that there
[9:22] are a whole bunch of pieces beyond just
[9:24] writing the code and some of those
[9:26] things remain outside of people's
[9:27] technical capacities now of course you
[9:29] can use vibe coding tools or separate
[9:31] LLMs to get help with those things and
[9:32] all of the vibe coding tools have some
[9:34] version of a single button push to
[9:36] publish still Andre Carpathy summed up a
[9:38] lot of people's feelings when he tweeted
[9:39] about a week ago "The reality of
[9:41] building web apps in 2025 is that it's a
[9:43] bit like assembling IKEA furniture
[9:45] there's no full stack product with
[9:46] batteries included you have to piece
[9:48] together and configure many individual
[9:49] services front end and back end hosting
[9:52] database authentication blob storage
[9:54] email payments background jobs analytics
[9:55] monitoring dev tools secrets etc he
[9:57] continues i'm relatively new to modern
[9:59] webdev and find the above a bit
[10:00] overwhelming eg i'm embarrassed to share
[10:02] it took me 3 hours the other day to
[10:04] create and configure a superbase with a
[10:05] Versell app and resolve a few errors the
[10:07] second you stray just slightly from the
[10:09] getting started tutorial in the docs
[10:10] you're suddenly in the wilderness it's
[10:12] not even code it's configurations
[10:14] plumbing orchestration workflows best
[10:15] practices a lot of glory will go to
[10:17] whoever figures out how to make it
[10:18] accessible and just work out of the box
[10:20] for both humans and increasingly and
[10:22] especially AIs now a lot of the vibe
[10:24] coding platforms showed up in the
[10:26] comments saying "Keep an eye out." Anton
[10:28] from Lovable said "Exactly what we're
[10:30] building at Lovable." One of the
[10:31] respondents though was Nicholas Charier
[10:33] who wrote "This is exactly our vision
[10:34] for Mocha not glued together developer
[10:36] tools all made slightly easier but a
[10:38] fully integrated one-stop shop." And
[10:40] this company Mocha was also just
[10:42] announced a couple of days ago nicholas
[10:44] writes "Introducing Mocha we're
[10:45] incredibly excited to launch the
[10:47] absolute best way to build full stack
[10:48] web apps no code no templates just
[10:50] describe what you want and watch it come
[10:52] to life he continues "For too long ideas
[10:54] have died because building products
[10:55] require too much technical knowledge
[10:57] we're changing this describe your vision
[10:59] in human terms get a complete working
[11:00] product in minutes keep ittering and
[11:02] adding features then deploy in one click
[11:04] all integrated unlike other website
[11:06] builders Mocha aims to be fully
[11:08] integrated you won't need to pay and
[11:09] connect five services to get off
[11:10] databases front-end hosting email etc
[11:12] just one we take a highly opinionated
[11:15] approach based on our experience
[11:16] building top web products like Pinterest
[11:17] and Next Door you describe outcomes
[11:19] Mocha handles the rest they even gave an
[11:21] example of what you could do nicholas
[11:23] calls out Tom a small business owner in
[11:25] Texas who operates an HVAC servicing
[11:26] company tom used Mocha to build
[11:28] customtailored web apps for each
[11:30] customer with personalized branding and
[11:31] functionality which he said increased
[11:33] deal conversion customer satisfaction
[11:34] and velocity by 200% and indeed he sums
[11:37] up our theme here at the end we're
[11:38] entering an era where everyone not just
[11:40] engineers can build personal software
[11:42] the era of idea people and personal
[11:44] software we couldn't be more excited now
[11:47] I haven't had a chance to dig into Mocha
[11:49] yet but in terms of us looking at
[11:50] startups both as very cool things on
[11:52] their own but also as reflective of
[11:53] trends it is so clear that this is where
[11:55] vibe coding is heading this is
[11:57] absolutely the next frontier the thing
[11:59] for people who are trying to push things
[12:00] beyond just prototyping and into
[12:01] production i think it is no mean feat to
[12:04] actually integrate this entire
[12:05] experience end to end but I also think
[12:07] that this is going to be completely
[12:09] table stakes for these companies it is
[12:11] going to be an absolute onslaught race
[12:13] between Bolt and Lovable and Mocha and
[12:15] the big beneficiary is all of us who get
[12:17] to build things that were never possible
[12:18] before so that is the list five startups
[12:21] that have come out in the past week that
[12:23] reflect some of AI's most important
[12:24] trends again we had General Agents who
[12:27] released ACE the real-time computer
[12:29] autopilot lindy who announced their
[12:31] agent swarms basically if you ever
[12:32] wanted your own army of employees now
[12:34] you can have it paid which is building
[12:36] agent infrastructure making it easier
[12:38] for agents to actually interact with
[12:40] financial rails vibe Code which is
[12:42] taking the vibe coding world onto mobile
[12:44] and Mocha which is advancing vibe coding
[12:46] entirely by moving towards an endto-end
[12:49] experience ai remains the most
[12:51] interesting and exciting space in the
[12:53] world and I'm thrilled to be able to
[12:54] share it with you every day for now
[12:56] that's going to do it for today's AI
[12:57] daily brief appreciate you listening or
[12:59] watching as always and until next time
[13:01] peace
