00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
welcome back to the AI Daily Brief every

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
day it feels like a million new cool AI

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
startups launch so much so that it's

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
actually pretty rare that we dig deep

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and cover brand new companies on this

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
show and yet over the past couple of

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
days I've seen a handful of companies

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that are on the one hand just very

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
impressive and interesting and seemingly

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
high potential and additionally really

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
reflect and tell the story of key trends

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
shaping AI right now so what we're going

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to do today is look at these five or so

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
new companies all of which have been

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
announced literally over the last 48

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
hours or so talk about them or their new

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
products that have been announced but

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
then also put them in the larger context

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
first up we have General Agents ceo

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Sergio Ojair formerly of Tesla and

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Google DeepMind writes "Today I'm

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
launching my new company General Agents

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and our first product introducing Ace

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the first real-time computer autopilot

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
ace is not a chatbot ace performs tasks

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
for you on your computer using your

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
mouse and keyboard at superhuman speeds

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
now by the way this is a show that's

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
going to be much better if you watch it

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
because there's lots of examples going

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
on you should be able to watch it in the

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Spotify app or on YouTube but Sherjo

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
goes on Ace can use all the tools on

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
your computer and the video shared shows

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
it grabbing images dropping them into

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Google Drive and generally doing the

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
types of things that a human would do

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
their preview videos also show the

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
method of interaction in Premiere Pro it

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
shows a user using the Ace bar to for

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
example slow the video clip down to 50%

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
split the clip once with the cut tool

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and then export it and again you're

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
using verbal instructions and then

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
letting ACE actually do the work they

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
point out that this can be really

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
helpful not just for increasing your

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
speed and efficiency but also for tools

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
that you're still learning how to use

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
there's a bunch of other things about

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
ACE as well but the big thing that

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
they're hammering is that it's fast in

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
fact they claim 20 times faster than

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
competing agents making it as they say

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
more practical for everyday use speed is

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
definitely what caught people's

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
attention with this replet CEO Amjad

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Msad said "Insane speed computer use

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
models have not seen major commercial

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
breakthrough because they're slow and

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
expensive this is a huge unlock."

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
William Gus a former research scientist

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
at OpenAI who's now a general agent as

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
well writes "Ace is the world's fastest

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
AI computer use agent this is

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
fundamentally a new way to use computers

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
when someone asked "How does it work?"

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
William responded "It takes in pixels

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and instructions and outputs click drag

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
keyboard etc actions at 300 milliseconds

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
roundtrip latency." In other words it's

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
doing full screenshot image processing

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
extremely quickly now in terms of the

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
discussion around this outside of it

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
just being fast some people pointed out

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that advances coming from startups like

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
this mean that it's not just the big

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
labs that are going to have all the fun

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
in the new era f schuman on Twitter also

80
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
pointed out that the expansion of human

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
creativity to go with a theme from

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
yesterday's show is one of the

83
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
byproducts of this type of computer use

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
tool where as he puts it anyone can now

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
operate software without even knowing

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
how to operate it that is a huge

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
breakthrough and certainly wasn't on my

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
bingo card for this year so there are

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
obviously a lot of themes that I think

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
this startup represents broadly speaking

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
of course agents the most important most

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
dominant category of AI advancements

93
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
right now but more specifically this

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
idea of expanding agent capabilities

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
through computer use this is something

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that we started to see inklings of at

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the end of last year and this appears to

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
be a major jump forward on that

99
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
obviously if you listen to yesterday's

100
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
show about the five fastchanging AI

101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
transformations that'll keep you up at

102
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
night you'll have heard me talk about

103
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the expansion of human creativity and as

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
we just heard being able to talk at

105
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
software and have your agent do it with

106
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you does absolutely expand which

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
software tools a person can use lastly

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the fact that the speed of computer use

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
is now exceeding humans I think gives us

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
a glimpse into the future where AI and

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
agents aren't just as performant as

112
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
people but are actually better at things

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
now obviously AI is better at many

114
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
things already but this is a highly

115
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
visual example of that another theme

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
which it's a little too early to explore

117
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
is whether US state-of-the-art agent

118
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
capabilities can drive as much virality

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
as recent releases from China like Manis

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
we might be a little constrained in this

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
case because general agents is only

122
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
available as a research preview not as a

123
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
full product but still that's something

124
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that I'll be watching next up we have

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Lindy and of course while Lindy isn't

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
new its new swarms feature is i won't

127
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
spend a ton of time on this because I

128
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
got into it yesterday but I think

129
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
co-founder Lindy Drop actually does a

130
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
great job explaining this she writes

131
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
"This AI agent turns one workflow into a

potential i created a simple flow that

174
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
triggers when new URLs are added to a

175

spreadsheet creates a loop that

176
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
processes each URL simultaneously

177
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
transcribes each video and generates a

178
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
professionally formatted blog post and

179
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
then returns all completed posts and

180
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
chat messages and so what's the theme

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
here it's not just agents obviously

182
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
we've already covered agents as the big

183
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
dominant theme no what's interesting to

184
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
me is this is effectively my Doctor

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Strange theory of AI agent work come to

186
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
for existing work this is the very early

188
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
innings of what you can do if you were

189
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
able to hire hundreds of people instead

190
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
of just one for a particular task those

191
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
370 personalized emails that Lindy sent

192
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
is an example of how you would apply

193
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
this to sales i think we are going to

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
see so much more of this in the next few

195
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
months and it's actually going to take

196
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the new capabilities being available

197
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
before people can even come close to

198
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
figuring out how to actually take full

199
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
advantage

200
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
startup number three is called Paid and

201
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
a very appropriate name it is manny

million euro to solve the biggest

205
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
problem no one's talking about in AI ai

206
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
agents are growing fast but face a

207
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
critical challenge how to monetize and

208
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
capture the value they create

209
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
traditional software billing doesn't

210
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
solve this problem at Paid we're solving

211
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
this problem by smart pricing that

212
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
aligns with actual value creation

213
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
real-time margin tracking to ensure

214
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
profitability clear dashboards that

215
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
demonstrate ROI to customers billing

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
invoicing revenue recovery taxes and all

217
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the back office needs in a single pane

218
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
of glass with just a few lines of codes

219
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
AI builders can focus on creating

220
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
amazing agents while we handle the

221
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
business engine behind them summing it

222
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
up even more clearly their website calls

223
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
this the business engine for AI agents

224
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
to me this is reflective of the fact

225
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that agents are now officially shifting

226
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
from interesting toys and novelties to

227
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
actual productionready tools that are

228
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
going to go in and change how we do work

229
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
paid is an example of the critical

230
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
infrastructure that is being built to

231
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
enable agents to live up to their full

232
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
potential effectively everything that

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
human employees do now every service

234
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
that we have around them is going to

235
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
have some proximate version in the agent

236
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
world this is going to be an incredibly

237
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
rich vein for startups in the coming

238
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
years and as you can see is already

239
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
happening with Gusto right now next up

240
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
we're moving on from agents at least

241
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
sort of to another huge theme of the

242
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
moment which is of course vibe coding

243
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and for that we turn to the company

244
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
called yes vibe code they write in order

245
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
for billions of people to vibe code we

246
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
need a tool with the power of cursor and

247
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
the simplicity of chat GBT that they

248
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
argue is the new app that they've built

249
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
vibe code now this comes from Riley

250
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Brown and his co-founders riley was and

251
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is I think the world's biggest AI Tik

252
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Tocker but over the past six months or

253
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
so has really gone allin on vibe coding

254
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
he's been building things for himself

255
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
using content to come up with new

256
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
theories of how creators are going to

257
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
code things in the future and this is

258
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
the app that he and some friends

259
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
basically built for himself to do what

260
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
he wanted to do one of the examples he

261
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
showed off was vibe coding a mobile

262
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
video game in a single prompt and what's

263
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
cool about this if you've used something

264
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
like Lovable and Bolt is that this is a

265
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
native mobile interface instead of

266
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
focusing on web applications Vive Code

267
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
is starting with a focus on mobile

268
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
applications and when excited users

269
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
started posting on the announcement

270
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
thread that signup wasn't working Vive

271
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Code basically said that they were

272
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
already full up so in terms of the

273
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
themes here obviously Vive coding in

274
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
general is a big one but the mobile

275
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
integration is really fascinating as

276
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
well as Eddie Yun points out right now

277
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
the average interaction with vibe coding

278
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
is still via text but imagine vibe

279
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
coding with voice funny enough when

280
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Andre Karpathy originally talked about

281
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
vibe coding he talked about how he was

282
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
using whisper to talk to his computer to

283
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
do it so in some ways this would be an

284
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
actual instantiation of where the whole

285
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
thing started vibe codeandanda writes

286
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
"The best feeling in the world is when

287
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
you build something and others can use

288
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
it with vibe code we hope to enable

289
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
anyone get that feeling." And of course

290
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that is the big resonance of vibe coding

291
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
with people is this expansion of human

292
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
creativity and creative capacity and

293
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that was not the only example one of the

294
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
challenges for vibe coders is that there

295
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
are a whole bunch of pieces beyond just

296
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
writing the code and some of those

297
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
things remain outside of people's

298
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
technical capacities now of course you

299
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
can use vibe coding tools or separate

300
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
LLMs to get help with those things and

301
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
all of the vibe coding tools have some

302
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
version of a single button push to

303
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
publish still Andre Carpathy summed up a

304
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
lot of people's feelings when he tweeted

305
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
about a week ago "The reality of

306
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
building web apps in 2025 is that it's a

307
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
bit like assembling IKEA furniture

308
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
there's no full stack product with

309
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
batteries included you have to piece

310
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
together and configure many individual

311
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
services front end and back end hosting

312
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
database authentication blob storage

313
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
email payments background jobs analytics

314
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
monitoring dev tools secrets etc he

315
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
continues i'm relatively new to modern

316
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
webdev and find the above a bit

317
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
overwhelming eg i'm embarrassed to share

318
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
it took me 3 hours the other day to

319
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
create and configure a superbase with a

320
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Versell app and resolve a few errors the

321
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
second you stray just slightly from the

322
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
getting started tutorial in the docs

323
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you're suddenly in the wilderness it's

324
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
not even code it's configurations

325
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
plumbing orchestration workflows best

326
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
practices a lot of glory will go to

327
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
whoever figures out how to make it

328
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
accessible and just work out of the box

329
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
for both humans and increasingly and

330
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
especially AIs now a lot of the vibe

331
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
coding platforms showed up in the

332
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
comments saying "Keep an eye out." Anton

333
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
from Lovable said "Exactly what we're

334
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
building at Lovable." One of the

335
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
respondents though was Nicholas Charier

336
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
who wrote "This is exactly our vision

337
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
this company Mocha was also just

example of what you could do nicholas

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
calls out Tom a small business owner in

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
deal conversion customer satisfaction

372
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and velocity by 200% and indeed he sums

373
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
up our theme here at the end we're

374
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
entering an era where everyone not just

375
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
engineers can build personal software

376
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
the era of idea people and personal

377
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
software we couldn't be more excited now

378
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I haven't had a chance to dig into Mocha

379
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
yet but in terms of us looking at

380
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
startups both as very cool things on

381
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
their own but also as reflective of

382
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
trends it is so clear that this is where

383
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
vibe coding is heading this is

384
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
absolutely the next frontier the thing

385
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
for people who are trying to push things

386
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
beyond just prototyping and into

387
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
production i think it is no mean feat to

388
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
actually integrate this entire

389
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
experience end to end but I also think

390
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
that this is going to be completely

391
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
table stakes for these companies it is

392
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
going to be an absolute onslaught race

393
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
between Bolt and Lovable and Mocha and

394
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
the big beneficiary is all of us who get

395
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to build things that were never possible

396
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
before so that is the list five startups

397
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that have come out in the past week that

398
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
reflect some of AI's most important

399
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
trends again we had General Agents who

400
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
released ACE the real-time computer

401
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
autopilot lindy who announced their

402
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
agent swarms basically if you ever

403
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
wanted your own army of employees now

404
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
you can have it paid which is building

405
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
agent infrastructure making it easier

406
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
for agents to actually interact with

407
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
financial rails vibe Code which is

408
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
taking the vibe coding world onto mobile

409
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and Mocha which is advancing vibe coding

410
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
entirely by moving towards an endto-end

411
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
experience ai remains the most

412
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
interesting and exciting space in the

413
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
world and I'm thrilled to be able to

414
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
share it with you every day for now

415
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that's going to do it for today's AI

416
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
daily brief appreciate you listening or

417
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
watching as always and until next time

418
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
peace
